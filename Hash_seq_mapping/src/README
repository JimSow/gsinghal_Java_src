README FOR TEST CASES

Here are some test cases on which to exercise your hash table code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

** CASE 1

These are some very short sequences that I made up just to help you test your
implementation.  You should use match length = 3 for what you submit.  The
output should be:

CORPUS: 38 bases
PATTERN: 27 bases
MASK: 27 bases
Match length? 3

After creating the table, it holds 20 sequences of length 3
After removing the mask sequences, the table holds 9 sequences of length 3

29 21 cat

There were 15 matches found.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

** CASE 2

These sequences come from the beta globin locus control region.  This
part of the genome encodes several different forms of the hemoglobin
protein used to transport oxygen in red blood cells.  The locus
control region is part of a mechanism that controls which of these
different forms of hemoglobin is produced at each stage of a person's
life (fetal, neonatal, and afterwards).

The two sequences in this case come from the human and mouse genomes.
If you compare these sequences, you'll get a large number of
uninteresting matches with sequences like "ttttttttttttttttt" and
"acacacacacac".  These matches are called "short tandem repeats."
They are not autonomous like the (much longer!) interspersed repeats;
rather, they probably arise from copying errors during DNA
replication.  To remove most of these repeats from the output, I've
provided a mask sequence that lists some common ones.

You should use a match length = 15 for what you submit.  The output you
should get is:

CORPUS: 19810 bases
PATTERN: 12460 bases
MASK: 1079 bases
Match length? 15

After creating the table, it holds 11570 sequences of length 15
After removing the mask sequences, the table holds 11559 sequences of length 15

There were 26 matches found.

You can see that the positions of most of the matches fall into
distinct clusters, which correspond to individual "hot-spots" within
the region that contain the conserved regulatory sites.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

** CASE 3

These sequences come from the mnd2 locus.  The mnd2 gene encodes a
protein important to correct functioning of the nerves that carry
impulses from the brain to the muscles.  In mice, mutations in this
gene cause "motor neuron degeneration 2" syndrome, which is closely
related to certain kinds of muscular dystrophy in humans.
 
The two sequences in this case come from the human and mouse genomes.
There is no mask sequence.   Submit your output for a match length
of 18.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

** CASE 4

These sequences come from the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) locus.
The BTK gene encodes a protein that transduces signals to activate
cells in the immune system.  Mutations in this gene cause a severe
type of inherited immunodeficiency called agammaglobulinemia.

The two sequences in this case again come from the human and mouse
genomes.  I've removed the common repeats with a program called
RepeatMasker, which replaces them with X's.  There is a mask sequence
that filters out most of the matches between these X's.  This locus
contains regions of very high similarity, so to avoid generating huge
amounts of output, submit your output for a match length of 65.
