I added some additional events to teh allEvents data set to bring it
to 1000 events.  Most of the added events were found

    http://150.wustl.edu/history.html

The format for allEvents and 20events is as follows.  For each event
there is a line that first has the date, then there is a tab which
is followed by a description for the event that is up to 250 characters
long.  

You are welcome to change the format of these data files if that makes your
task easier but you cannot change the contents.
